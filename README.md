I'm a recent graduate of Makers Academy and a passionate and empathetic full-stack software engineer working with Javascript, Ruby and Python. Driven by industry best-practices, collaboration and self-growth, I bring a natural curiosity and energy to my work in web-development, across the stack. With a degree in Creative Computing from Goldsmiths, University of London, I have a solid foundation in both computer science and creative problem-solving. In addition, my extensive experience leading teams in high-end catering has honed my communication, collaboration, and project management skills. My technical and soft skills, combined with my endless appetite for learning and growth, make me an exceptional candidate for any junior position.

## Experience

**Goldsmiths, University of London (2021- 2022)** </br>
**Teaching Assistant, Department of Computer Science**

- Using field knowledge and sharp communication skills, assisted in teaching both first & second years in various Computer Science modules, including ‘Dynamic Web Applications’ & ‘Problem Solving for Computer Science’.
- Able to explain complex concepts accessibly and actively saw students’ learning develop.
- Often tasked with debugging students' code methodically and meticulously.
- Actively participated in providing pastoral care and support to students.
- Assisted in learning plans, adjusting learning for different capabilities.

**Culinary Experience, various Restaurants (2015 - 2022)** </br>
**Sous Chef - Maître d'**

## Skills

#### Communication

Throughout my experience in senior positions within a kitchen team, I developed crucial skills in delegation, overseeing learning, and conflict resolution. When I joined Makers, I was able to apply these skills to our group projects, taking on the role of leading end-of-sprint retrospectives and managing our team's Trello board. By maintaining the board and ensuring all team members were aware of project milestones, I facilitated clear communication and timely resolution of any roadblocks. Thanks to these efforts, our team was able to consistently meet project deadlines with high-quality results. Not only does this make me a joy to work with, it also means i have great client-facing skills.

#### Problem Solving

With a natural aptitude for mathematics and logic, I excel at managing complex programming problems. My background in mathematics and computing has provided me with the skills to confidently approach technical tasks. For example, while developing StepFreeGigs, I implemented a custom API to manage multiple external API calls to 3 destinations. One challenge that arose was filtering the necessary data from the APIs while optimising performance. To solve this, I utilised caching with Axios, which limited the number of outgoing calls and allowed us to stay within our development limits. As a result, the project was completed efficiently and effectively.

#### Adaptability

I possess strong problem-solving skills and as a self-starter, I am able direct my own learning on topics that are less familiar to me. My ability to independently overcome challenges was crucial to my success during my final project completed during the Makers Academy bootcamp, where over the course of 2 weeks we developed a fully test-driven and functioning React Native mobile app, a technology that no one on the team had ever used before. I would often teach new concepts of the technology to my peers as I was learning it, solidifying my own understanding.

#### Technical
**Languages**: Javascript • TypeScript • Python • Ruby </br>
**Frameworks**: React • React Native • Express • Jest • Cypress • Flask • Sinatra • OpenFrameworks • p5.js • pandas </br>
**Databases**: MySQL • PostgreSQL • MongoDB </br>
**DevOps**: Git • Test-Driven Development • Pair Programming • Linux • Figma </br>

## Hobbies
I'm a musician of the stringed variety. I probably have too many guitars, currently learning the Oud, the oldest stringed instrument in the world. </br>
As a nature lover, I make sure to carve out time to go camping and hiking outside of the city.
