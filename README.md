## Skills

#### Communication

A proven track record of postitions held in education, hopsitality and community work have honed my communication and interpersonal skills, able to approach situations with tact, empathy or honesty where needed. Not only does this make me a joy to work with, it also means i have great client-facing skills.

#### Attention to detail

I take great pride in producing code that is elegant, efficient and reliable, consistently researching coding best practices. 

#### Adaptability

I am highly motivated by challenges and look forward to these opportunites as they have the potential for professional growth. I can pick up new technologies fast through independant learning, and i have decveloped an attitude towards technological solutions that is language agnostic. I belive my knowledge of principles and concepts are invaluable and i have confidence applying them to any programming language that best solves a particular problem, regardless of my familiarity with it.
